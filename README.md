# Hugoverse: Headless CMS for Hugo

**Hugoverse** is a headless CMS designed for Hugo, providing a seamless way to manage your static website content. With its powerful APIs, you can upload articles and resources like images, preview your site in real-time, and deploy it effortlessly to the cloud‚Äîall tailored to your selected Hugo theme.

Hugoverse is inspired by two great open-source projects:

- [Ponzu CMS](https://github.com/ponzu-cms/ponzu)
- [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)

A big thank you to the creators and contributors of these projects! 
Hugoverse builds upon their ideas while introducing additional modifications and restructuring.

## Disclaimer

The domain **gohugo.net** and the GitHub organization **gohugonet** are **not** affiliated with the official Hugo project. 
They were created by me as part of this open-source initiative. 
If this causes any confusion, I am open to relocating the project to a different domain and organization to clarify its independence.
