# ADR: Site and Page Path Relationship Design

**Date:** 2024-09-23

## Context

In the design of a Hugo Headless CMS, there is a requirement to allow a site to switch themes. If the new theme is of the same type, page paths can be reused. If the new theme is of a different type, the page paths will need to be reconfigured. Additionally, if all page paths are changed, the system should treat this as a completely new site.

## Decision

We have decided to use a `SitePage` object to manage the relationship between a site and its posts, where the `SitePage` stores the path information indicating where the post will be stored in the file system (e.g., `docs/index.md`).

If the paths of all the pages are modified, we will treat it as a different `Site`, even though the content may be the same.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Store path information directly in the `Page` object

**Pros**:
- Simpler data model where path information is tied directly to the page.
- Fewer database lookups since the path is part of the `Page` object.

**Cons**:
- Less flexibility for supporting different themes or paths based on theme changes.
- Managing different paths across themes would complicate the `Page` object.
- Limited reusability if the page needs to be shared between sites or themes.

### Option 2: Store path information in a separate `SitePage` object (Chosen)

**Pros**:
- Allows greater flexibility by decoupling page content from its path.
- Simplifies theme switching, as paths can be reconfigured independently of the content.
- Enables reusing page content across different themes or configurations.

**Cons**:
- Slightly more complex data model, requiring an additional lookup for path information.
- Additional logic is needed to handle theme switching and path configuration.

## Outcome

The decision to use `SitePage` provides the flexibility to manage the page-to-path relationship independently of the content itself. If the theme is changed but belongs to the same type (i.e., the same theme category), paths can be reused. However, if all the page paths are modified, this will be treated as a new `Site`.

### Structure Example
```go
package content

type SitePage struct {
  siteId int
  postId int
  path string
}

```

## Consequences

- A more flexible design that allows different themes to have unique paths.
- Easier maintenance and expansion, particularly for supporting different theme types.
- Treating changes in all page paths as a new site adds clarity to the distinction between different site configurations.

## Status

**Accepted**
